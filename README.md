Hi. My name is David and I have been blessed enough to currently be working at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
We use an on premesis github at JPL so much of what I work on isn't publicly available. But I mostly do a lot
dev ops type work and maintenance of existing code bases. Updating dependencies to address security issues is
an ongoing thing that I work on. But I also get to work on some code for the Psyche mission. Psyche is a really
cool mission where the spacecraft called Psyche will be visiting the asteroid Psyche 16. It uses electric
propulsion and should arrive at its destination in early 2029. Hopefully by then I will be able to work on day
to day engineering activities with the spacecraft. I can't wait!
